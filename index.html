    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated bird, with attributes of wild species such as the red
        and grey
        junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and
        a
        younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
        a hen
        and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic
        period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
        their
        meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>
